Description:

Our AirBnB_clone software is a comprehensive web application meticulously crafted to mirror the core 
functionalities of the globally recognized AirBnB platform. While it won't encompass every 
intricate feature of the original, it serves as an exceptional platform for you to refine 
your coding prowess and build a fully functional web application.

How It Works: 
Let's delve into the software's core components and the intricate software engineering elements involved:

The Console: At the project's core lies a command interpreter that empowers you to create 
a data model and manipulate objects without the need for a visual interface. This invaluable 
tool serves a dual purpose—facilitating development and aiding in debugging. 
Data persistence is elegantly achieved through the serialization of objects into JSON files.

Web Static: 

HTML and CSS serve as the fundamental building blocks for structuring the application and 
crafting object templates. This is where you'll apply User Interface (UI) design principles 
to create an engaging, user-friendly interface that captivates your users.

MySQL Storage: 

Elevate your data storage capabilities by transitioning from file-based storage to a robust 
relational database system. Employ the power of Object-Relational Mapping (O.R.M.) to seamlessly 
map your models to database tables, ensuring efficient data management.

Web Framework - Templating:

Python takes center stage as you construct a dynamic web server. Static HTML files are ingeniously 
transformed into dynamic pages using templates. Data retrieval from either files or databases is 
executed with precision, enhancing the overall user experience.

RESTful API:
 
Your API serves as a pivotal bridge between the front-end and your data. It diligently adheres to 
the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), exposing stored objects through a 
meticulously designed JSON web interface. This empowers your users to effortlessly manipulate data.

Web Dynamic:
 
Leverage the capabilities of JQuery for dynamic web development. This empowers you to load objects 
seamlessly from the client-side using your RESTful API, resulting in an immersive and interactive 
user experience.

Files and Directories: 

The project's architecture is meticulously organized into directories, housing models, unit tests, 
and a command interpreter. This deliberate approach ensures a structured, maintainable, and highly 
scalable codebase, following industry-best software engineering practices.

Storage: 
Effective data management and persistence are at the core of this project. It skillfully manages 
both file and database storage, all while maintaining the modularity and independence of your models—a 
hallmark of sound software engineering.

*args, kwargs: 

Dynamic function arguments provide the codebase with the flexibility and adaptability needed to address
various scenarios gracefully. This software engineering feature ensures that your application remains 
agile and capable of handling diverse use cases.
